## General info
I created this project to gain a better understanding of React, from working on this project I've gained a better understanding of React Router and Usestates while also being able to work on my other front end languages. 

The homepage displays all the pages together but if you click navigate using the header you can view each page seperately. However the sign up is not on the homepage and can only be accesed from the header. 


## Technologies
Project is created with:
* HTML: 5
* CSS : 3
* React
* Javascript
